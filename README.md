## Project Description
Our project aims to solve the inefficiency of manual work reporting in fast-paced professional environments. We are designing an AI-driven system that allows employees to record "stream-of-consciousness" voice updates, which are then automatically transcribed, filtered for verbal clutter, and reformatted into structured, professional documentation for managers.

## Current Project Phase
**Phase 1: Research & Planning**
*Status: Initial project scope, user research planning, and technical foundation definition.*

## Technical Foundation (Preview)
- **Runtime:** Bun.js (TypeScript)
- **AI Models:** OpenAI Whisper (STT) & GPT-4o (Reasoning)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible Object Storage (Cloudflare R2) & PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure:** Redis/BullMQ for asynchronous task processing
